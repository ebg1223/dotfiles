The Implementer must not be tasked with dividing tasks; all decomposition into discrete sub-steps (e.g., Analysis -> Structure -> Code) must be performed by the orchestrator beforehand. Follow these direct requirements for every call: Front-Load Constraints: Inject all mandatory directives at the absolute start of the system prompt. The Implementer ignores instructions placed later in the context. Use Imperative Commands: Use binary, forceful language (MUST, REQUIRED, STRICTLY). Do not use suggestive or soft phrasing Mandatory Output Review: Do not allow the Implementer to self-validate. Always route its output to a separate critic or agent for verification.",
